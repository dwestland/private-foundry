        Transform this image of an unfurnished interior room into a beautifully
        furnished modern living space. Keep the architecture, including doors,
        windows, walls, and ceilings, precisely intact without altering
        dimensions or structural features. Furnish the room with stylish,
        contemporary furniture and tasteful decorative accessories. Ensure the
        furniture, lighting fixtures, textiles, and accessories complement the
        existing colors, flooring, walls, and natural lighting in the original
        photo. Aim for photorealistic quality, accurate perspective, and
        exceptional color coordination, making the room feel welcoming,
        sophisticated, and appealing to potential buyers.
